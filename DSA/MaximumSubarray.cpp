// Problem: Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum. This is also known as Kadane's Algorithm problem.â€‹

// Example:

// Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]

// Output: 6

// Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum of 6.
